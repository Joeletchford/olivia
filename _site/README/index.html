<h1>11ty + TACHYONS</h1>
<h2>Quickly begin prototyping using 11ty and Tachyons.</h2>
<p>Get started by deploying <strong>11ty+Tachyons</strong> to Netlify.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/whaleen/11ty-tachyons"><img src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy to Netlify"></a></p>
<p>See the <a href="https://11ty-tachyons.netlify.com">demo</a> of a Netlify deploy.</p>
<h3>Clone and develop locally</h3>
<p>If you have deployed to Netlify, note any change to the repository name you may have made as the following command will need to be changed to match.</p>
<p><code>git clone https://github.com/whaleen/11ty-tachyons my-site-name</code></p>
<p><code>cd my-site-name</code></p>
<p><code>npm install</code></p>
<p><code>npm start</code></p>
<h3>Note to Jekyll users:</h3>
<p>This template may be an ideal introduction to 11ty for you. It is structured in a manner that is similar to a Jekyll project. I recommend you to read <a href="https://24ways.org/2018/turn-jekyll-up-to-eleventy/">this article</a> to get up to speed.</p>
<h3>Make It Your Own</h3>
<ol>
<li>Edit <code>/_data/site.json</code> which contains things such as the site name, author, Google Analytics ID, etc...</li>
<li>Go wild with Tachyons</li>
</ol>
<h3>Tachyons</h3>
<p>A Saas distribution of Tachyons can be found in <code>/scss/</code>. Additional CSS can be written in <code>/scss/custom.scss</code> for convenience.</p>

<h3>11ty</h3>
<p>A very nice Static Site Generator.</p>
