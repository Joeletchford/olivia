# 11ty + TACHYONS

## Quickly begin prototyping using Tachyons class names.

Get started by deploying **11ty+Tachyons** to Netlify.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/whaleen/11ty-tachyons)

### Clone and develop locally

If you have deployed to Netlify, note any change to the repository name you may have made as the following command will need to be changed to match.

```git clone https://github.com/whaleen/11ty-tachyons my-site-name```

```cd my-site-name```

```npm install```

```npx eleventy --serve```


### Note to Jekyll users:

This template may be an ideal introduction to 11ty for you. It is structured in a manner that is similar to a Jekyll project. I recommend you to read [this article](https://24ways.org/2018/turn-jekyll-up-to-eleventy/) to get up to speed.


### Make It Your Own

1. Edit ```/_data/site.json``` which contains things such as the site name, author, Google Analytics ID, etc...
2. Go wild with Tachyons

### Tachyons

A stylesheet called tachyons.css is placed in the assets folder: ```/assets/css/tachyons.css```

Introducing Sass or any other CSS related tool is up to you. 11ty does not include such things by default.


### 11ty

A very nice Static Site Generator.
