[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/whaleen/11ty-tachyons)

### Note to Jekyll users:

This template may be an ideal introduction to 11ty for you. It is structured in a manner that is similar to a Jekyll project. I recommend you to read [this article](https://24ways.org/2018/turn-jekyll-up-to-eleventy/) to get up to speed.


### Configuration

See /_data/site.json

### CSS

Tachyons is a CSS library. It will be found here in this project: ```/assets/css/tachyons.css```

You can begin prototyping immediately using Tachyons class names.

Please learn about Tachyons here.


### Assets

There are no javascript files, however, a directory is in place.
Some sample images have been placed in the img directory. These sample images are referenced in sample posts in the _posts directory.
