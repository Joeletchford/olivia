# 11ty + TACHYONS

Get started now by deploying *11ty+Tachyons* to Netlify.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/whaleen/11ty-tachyons)

### Note to Jekyll users:

This template may be an ideal introduction to 11ty for you. It is structured in a manner that is similar to a Jekyll project. I recommend you to read [this article](https://24ways.org/2018/turn-jekyll-up-to-eleventy/) to get up to speed.


### Make It Your Own

Edit ```/_data/site.json``` which contains things such as the site name, author, Google Analytics ID, etc...

### Tachyons

You can begin prototyping immediately using Tachyons class names.

A stylesheet called tachyons.css is placed in the assets folder: ```/assets/css/tachyons.css```

Please [learn about Tachyons](https://tachyons.io).


### 11ty

A very nice Static Site Generator.
